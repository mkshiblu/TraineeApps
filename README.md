# Trainee Apps
A demo app store for amateur app developers. It was the lab project for `Database Lab` in university. The code is written in core PHP and  MySQL was used as the database. Bootstrap was used to make the site responsive.

### How to Run

1.  Download and extract the source and move the folder to the htdocs folder of XAMPP Server.
2.  Run the XAMPP Server from the control panel
3.  Run the appstore.sql in the MySQL db to generate the proper tables and seed data.
4.  Properly provide the database name, user, password etc. in the dbconnectvars.php file inside of php folder.
5.  You should now be able to browse the app store.


### Notes

1. The project was a university project which I wrote about ~3 years ago. So it may not be written in a industry standard.
2. I uploaded the original source as it is.
